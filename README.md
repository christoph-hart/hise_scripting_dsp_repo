# HISE Scripting DSP repository

This repository contains a library for the HISE scripting environment with some tools for sample analysis & batch processing.

It can be used for creating customized workflows.

Currently featured:

- a harmonic analysis of a given sample
- a velocity automapper based on the peak level of the sample

Rather than hardcoding it in C++, this scripting library can be modified more easily to tune the algorithms / add more parameters.
